👋 Hi, I’m @BXL909. In a past life, I wrote mediocre code for a living. Now my skills are out of date and I want to learn new stuff.  
👀 I’m interested in ₿itcoin & Lightning⚡among other things.  
🌱 I’m currently learning C# & Python, hoping it's a gentle reintroduction back into coding after a long absence.  
⌛ Previously: BASIC, COBOL, VB, C, ASP, PHP, HTML, DirectX.
